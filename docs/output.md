# # Output Folder

The output folder contains logs of the execution and SIEM rule files ready for upload. These files are generated during the SIEGMA execution and can be directly utilized for uploading rules to the relevant SIEM platform. If you wish to modify the file names, you can do so by passing appropriate arguments. For more details, please look at the [arguments documentation](./arguments.md) or type --help for assistance.
